Ans-
    1.console.log() :- prints the element in an HTML-like tree.
    2.console.table() :- It presents the data in a clear tabular format.
    3.console.group():- it becomes really simple to properly organize related data and represent each group with a definitive group label while logging to the console.
    4.console.dir() :- prints the element in a JSON-like tree from where we can inspect the element DOM properties.
    5.onsole.trace() :- prints the stack trace of callable functions to the console from the point it is called.
    6.console.assert() :- it is used to run simple assertion tests.
    7.console.time() :- starts a timer that can be used to compute the duration of an operation.
    8.console.timeEnd() ;- stops the timer and print total run time in milliseconds.

Question 2
Ans-
    Var:-
        var variables can be re-declared and updated
        var greeter = "hey hi";
        greeter = "say Hello";

    Let:-
        let can be updated but not re-declared.
        we have to define it in different scope.
         let greeting = "say Hi";
        if (true) {
            let greeting = "say Hello instead";
            console.log(greeting);
            }
        console.log(greeting);

    Const:-
        const cannot be updated or re-declared.
        const greeting = "say Hi";
        greeting = "say Hello instead";

Question 3

            Undefined-represents undefined value
            Null-represents null i.e. no value at all

        #non primitive data type are-
            object-represent instance through which we can access members
            array-represents group of similar values
            regexp-represent regular expression
